Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The ones that had a really high win chance, and the ones that had no win chance.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100,000 simulations were sufficient to get enough data.
