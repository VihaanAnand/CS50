Based on the average danceability of 0.71646, average energy of 0.65906, and average valence of 0.484443, I would say that this person is slightly energetic, likes to dance, and doesn't care too much about the mood of his songs. All in all, he is a neutral energetic person. However, this is not very accurate because it doesn't take every song into account correctly, and doesn't consider every attribute of the song. I would calculate this by using every attribute given, and calculating each song based on number of streams. For example, instead of averaging, if he listened to a song 100 times, and his top 100 were listened to 5,050 times, this particular song represents about 1.9801% of his top 100. I would then take each attribute, and multiply it by that 1.9801%. After calculating each of these attributes for each song in this method, I would sum each attribute (all energy, all valence, etc.) and use this for the determination of his top moods.
